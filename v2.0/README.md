This is my portfolio, built with React.
Dependecies include Swiperjs,emailjs,react-icons,react-reveal,react-typical.
The project was initiated with create-react-app, and uses a src based file structure, which each section of this site in its own folder. along with its css and helper files. it is not a really big project and hence i am not gonna go deep into the file structure of it, I am sure any entry level js developer can figure out the app flow.

***full Disclosure, I took a lot of inspration from a lot of Portfolio Sites Online and Kinda composed all the inspiration into This Site...***
